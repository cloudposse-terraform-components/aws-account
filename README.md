This component is responsible for provisioning the full account hierarchy along with Organizational Units (OUs). It
includes the ability to associate Service Control Policies (SCPs) to the Organization, each Organizational Unit and
account.

> [!NOTE]
>
> Part of a [cold start](https://docs.cloudposse.com/layers/accounts/prepare-aws-organization/) so it has to be
> initially run with `SuperAdmin` role.

In addition, it enables
[AWS IAM Access Analyzer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/what-is-access-analyzer.html), which helps
you identify the resources in your organization and accounts, such as Amazon S3 buckets or IAM roles, that are shared
with an external entity. This lets you identify unintended access to your resources and data, which is a security risk.
Access Analyzer identifies resources that are shared with external principals by using logic-based reasoning to analyze
the resource-based policies in your AWS environment. For each instance of a resource that is shared outside of your
account, Access Analyzer generates a finding. Findings include information about the access and the external principal
that it is granted to. You can review findings to determine whether the access is intended and safe, or the access is
unintended and a security risk.

## Usage

**Stack Level**: Global

**IMPORTANT**: Account Name building blocks (such as tenant, stage, environment) must not contain dashes. Doing so will
lead to unpredictable resource names as a `-` is the default delimiter. Additionally, account names must be lower case
alphanumeric with no special characters. For example:

| Key              | Value           | Correctness |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------- |
| **Tenant**       | foo             | ✅          |
| **Tenant**       | foo-bar         | ❌          |
| **Environment**  | use1            | ✅          |
| **Environment**  | us-east-1       | ❌          |
| **Account Name** | `core-identity` | ✅          |

Here is an example snippet for how to use this component. Include this snippet in the stack configuration for the
management account (typically `root`) in the management tenant/OU (usually something like `mgmt` or `core`) in the
global region (`gbl`). You can insert the content directly, or create a `stacks/catalog/account.yaml` file and import it
from there.

## First Time Organization Setup

Your AWS Organization is managed by the `account` component, along with accounts and organizational units.

However, because the AWS defaults for an Organization and its accounts are not exactly what we want, and there is no way
to change them via Terraform, we have to first provision the AWS Organization, then take some steps on the AWS console,
and then we can provision the rest.

### Use AWS Console to create and set up the Organization

Unfortunately, there are some tasks that need to be done via the console. Log into the AWS Console with the root (not
SuperAdmin) credentials you have saved in 1Password.

#### Request an increase in the maximum number of accounts allowed

> [!WARNING]
>
> Make sure your support plan for the _root_ account was upgraded to the "Business" level (or Higher). This is necessary
> to expedite the quota increase requests, which could take several days on a basic support plan. Without it, AWS
> support will claim that since we’re not currently utilizing any of the resources, so they do not want to approve the
> requests. AWS support is not aware of your other organization. If AWS still gives you problems, please escalate to
> your AWS TAM.

1. From the region list, select "US East (N. Virginia) us-east-1".

2. From the account dropdown menu, select "My Service Quotas".

3. From the Sidebar, select "AWS Services".

4. Type "org" in the search field under "AWS services"

5. Click on "AWS Organizations" in the "Service" list

6. Click on "Default maximum number of accounts", which should take you to a new view

7. Click on "Request quota increase" on the right side of the view, which should pop us a request form

8. At the bottom of the form, under "Change quota value", enter the number you decided on in the previous step (probably
  "20") and click "Request"

#### (Optional) Create templates to request other quota increases

New accounts start with a low limit on the number of instances you can create. However, as you add accounts, and use
more instances, the numbers automatically adjust up. So you may or may not want to create a template to generate
automatic quota increase requests, depending on how many instances per account you expect to want to provision right
away.

Create a
[Quota request template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/organization-templates.html) for the
organization. From the Sidebar, click "Quota request template"

Add each EC2 quota increase request you want to make:

1. Click "Add Quota" on the right side of the view

2. Under "Region", select your default region (repeat with the backup region if you are using one)

3. Under "Service", type "EC2" and select "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)"

4. Under "Quota", find the quota you want to increase. The likely candidates are:

5. type "stand" and select "Running On-Demand Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) Instances"

6. type "stand" and select "All Standard (A, C, D, H, I, M, R, T, Z) Spot Instance Request"

7. type "g i" and select "Running On-Demand G Instances"

8. type "all g" and select "All G Spot Instance Requests"

9. Under "Desired quota value" enter your desired default quota

10. Click "Add"

After you have added all the templates, click "Enable" on the Quota request template screen to enable the templates.

#### Enable resource sharing with AWS Organization

[AWS Resource Access Manager (RAM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html) lets you share your
resources with any AWS account or through AWS Organizations.

<img src="/assets/refarch/image-20211116-045412.png" height="780" width="3774" /><br/>

If you have multiple AWS accounts, you can create resources centrally and use AWS RAM to share those resources with
other accounts.

Resource sharing through AWS Organization will be used to share the Transit Gateway deployed in the `network` account
with other accounts to connect their VPCs to the shared Transit Gateway.

This is a one-time manual step in the AWS Resource Access Manager console. When you share resources within your
organization, AWS RAM does not send invitations to principals. Principals in your organization get access to shared
resources without exchanging invitations.

To enable resource sharing with AWS Organization via AWS Management Console

- Open the Settings page of AWS Resource Access Manager console at
  [https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home#Settings](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ram/home#Settings)

- Choose "Enable sharing with AWS Organizations"

To enable resource sharing with AWS Organization via AWS CLI

```
√ . [xamp-SuperAdmin] (HOST) infra ⨠ aws ram enable-sharing-with-aws-organization
{
    "returnValue": true
}
```

For more information, see:

- [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/what-is.html)

- [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html)

- [https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-ram.html](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/services-that-can-integrate-ram.html)

### Import the organization into Terraform using the `account` component

After we are done with the above ClickOps and the Service Quota Increase for maximum number of accounts has been
granted, we can then do the rest via Terraform.

In the Geodesic shell, as SuperAdmin, execute the following command to get the AWS Organization ID that will be used to
import the organization:

```
aws organizations describe-organization
```

From the output, identify the _organization-id_:

```
{
    "Organization": {
        "Id": "o-7qcakq6zxw",
        "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::
        ...
```

Using the example above, the _organization-id_ is o-7qcakq6zxw.

In the Geodesic shell, as SuperAdmin, execute the following command to import the AWS Organization, changing the stack
name `core-gbl-root` if needed, to reflect the stack where the organization management account is defined, and changing
the last argument to reflect the _organization-id_ from the output of the previous command.

```
atmos terraform import account --stack core-gbl-root 'aws_organizations_organization.this[0]' 'o-7qcakq6zxw'
```

### Provision AWS OUs and Accounts using the `account` component

AWS accounts and organizational units are generated dynamically by the `terraform/account` component using the
configuration in the `gbl-root` stack.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> In the rare case where you will need to be enabling non-default AWS Regions, temporarily comment out the
> `DenyRootAccountAccess` service control policy setting in `gbl-root.yaml`. You will restore it later, after enabling
> the optional Regions. See related:
> [Decide on Opting Into Non-default Regions](https://docs.cloudposse.com/layers/network/design-decisions/decide-on-opting-into-non-default-regions/)

> [!TIP]
>
> #### You must wait until your quota increase request has been granted
>
> If you try to create the accounts before the quota increase is granted, you can expect to see failures like
> `ACCOUNT_NUMBER_LIMIT_EXCEEDED`.

In the Geodesic shell, execute the following commands to provision AWS Organizational Units and AWS accounts:

```
atmos terraform apply account --stack gbl-root
```

Review the Terraform plan, _**ensure that no new organization will be created**_ (look for
`aws_organizations_organization.this[0]`), type "yes" to approve and apply. This creates the AWS organizational units
and AWS accounts.

### Configure root account credentials for each account

Note: unless you need to enable non-default AWS regions (see next step), this step can be done later or in parallel with
other steps, for example while waiting for Terraform to create resources.

**For** _**each**_ **new account:**

1. Perform a password reset by attempting to [log in to the AWS console](https://signin.aws.amazon.com/signin) as a
  "root user", using that account's email address, and then clicking the "Forgot password?" link. You will receive a
  password reset link via email, which should be forwarded to the shared Slack channel for automated messages. Click
  the link and enter a new password. (Use 1Password or [Random.org](https://www.random.org/passwords) to create a
  password 26-38 characters long, including at least 3 of each class of character: lower case, uppercase, digit, and
  symbol. You may need to manually combine or add to the generated password to ensure 3 symbols and digits are
  present.) Save the email address and generated password as web login credentials in 1Password. While you are at it,
  save the account number in a separate field.

2. Log in using the new password, choose "My Security Credentials" from the account dropdown menu and set up
  Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to use a Virtual MFA device. Save the MFA TOTP key in 1Password by using
  1Password's TOTP field and built-in screen scanner. Also, save the Virtual MFA ARN (sometimes shown as "serial
  number").

3. While logged in, enable optional regions as described in the next step, if needed.

4. (Optional, but highly recommended): [Unsubscribe](https://pages.awscloud.com/communication-preferences.html) the
  account's email address from all marketing emails.

### (Optional) Enable regions

Most AWS regions are enabled by default. If you are using a region that is not enabled by default (such as Middle
East/Bahrain), you need to take extra steps.

1. While logged in using root credentials (see the previous step), in the account dropdown menu, select "My Account" to
  get to the [Billing home page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billing/home?#/account).

2. In the "AWS Regions" section, enable the regions you want to enable.

3. Go to the IAM [account settings page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/account_settings) and edit the STS
  Global endpoint to create session tokens valid in all AWS regions.

You will need to wait a few minutes for the regions to be enabled before you can proceed to the next step. Until they
are enabled, you may get what look like AWS authentication or permissions errors.

After enabling the regions in all accounts, re-enable the `DenyRootAccountAccess` service control policy setting in
`gbl-root.yaml` and rerun

```
atmos terraform apply account --stack gbl-root
```
